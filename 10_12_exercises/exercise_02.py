# This program counts the distribution of the hour, of the day,
# for each of the messages. You can pull the hour from the "From"
# line by finding the time string and, then, splitting that string
# into the parts using the colon character. Once you have accumulated
# the coutrs, for each hour, print out the conts, one per line, sorted
# by hour, as shown in the textbook (pg. 129).
#
# The code for this exercise may be found in the file time_of_day.py
