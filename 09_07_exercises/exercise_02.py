# Write a program that categorizes each mail message,
# by which day of the week the commit was done.
# To do this, look for lines that start with, "From",
# then, look for the third word, and keep a running
# count, of each, of the days of the week.
# At the end of the program, print out the contents,
# of your dictionary (order doesn't matter).

# This file may be found at dow.py, in this folder.
