# There is a string method called `count` that is similar to the function in the previous exercise.
# Read the documentation of this method at:
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.count
# Write an invocation that counts the number of times the letter 'a' occurs in 'banana'.

string = 'banana'

letter = 'a'

results = string.count(letter)

print(results)
