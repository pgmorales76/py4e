# Change the socket program, socket1.py, to prompt the user for the URL,
# so it can read any webpage.

# You can use `aplit('/')` to break the URL into its component parts, so
# you can extract the host name for the socket`connect` call.

# Add error checking using `try` and `except` to handle the condition where
# the user enters an improperly formatted, or non-existent, URL.
