# Assume that we execure the following assignment statements:

width = 17

height = 12.0

# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression, and the type (of the value of the expression).

width // 12     # 1, int

width / 2.0     # 8.5, float

height / 3      # 4.0, float

1 + 2 * 5       # 11, int
