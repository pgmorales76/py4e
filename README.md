# Welcome to ***Python For Everybody***

This repo is dedicated to the online course, "Python For Everybody", and it's accompanying textbook, by Charles Severance (aka Dr. Chuck).

In the various folders, you'll find exercises, and answers, for each chapter, Powerpoint presentations from each chapter, and other items, such as Coursera cerificates, AI pdfs, and a Python guidebook for the TI Nspire.

I hope you find this page interesting, and helpful.

I recommend taking Dr. Chuck's course! It has been a tremendous help, in learning Python!

Below, you'll find the link for the coursepage.

Now, let's check out these HUGE Pythons!
